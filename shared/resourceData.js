        important: "Crochet hooks are a fundamental tool to the craft. Some may say that without crochet hooks, can one even crochet? Crochet hooks come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and materials. Plus, which hook you choose for a project matters.", 
        content: "\nThe primary differentiation for crochet hooks is size. While material can play an important role in purchasing decisions, it really is just a matter of personal preference. Crochet hook size can be measured in mm, by letter, or by number (with US sizing being different from UK sizing). Every hook will have a mm sizing while not every hook with have a letter or number. The usual size range spans from 2.0mm to 16.0mm with 0.25 or 0.5 increments. 2.0mm is the one of the smaller crochet hooks and is best suited to the lightest yarn weights (e.g. Lace or Thread). On the other hand, 16.00mm is rather large and should be used with the thickest yarn (e.g. Jumbo). Using a hook that is too small may result in you splitting your yarn, which using a hook that is too big may result great difficulty crocheting and large holes in your stitches."

        title: "All About Yarn", 
        important: "Yarn Weight, used to describe the thickness of a yarn skein, is an important topic to understand. Many patters you will encounter give a reccomended yarn wight (and hook size) for good reason. Yarns typically come in 7 thicknesses that range from the thickness of a thread to almost the thickness of a finger; the amount needed and hook used can vary greatly. Some yarn weights are also easier to work with than others when it comes to beginners: a heavier (thicker) weight tends to be reccomended. It is also good to keep in mind that some wieghts have alternate names (e.g. weight three is also called light)", 
        content: "\nTelling Yarn Weight From Skein Label\nThe most common, and easiest way, to determine yarn weight is to look at the yarns label. Pretty much ever yarn skeins label contains a symbol or description of the skeins wight. A yarn weight symbol is conprised of a skien of yarn with a number overlaid on top of it.\nEach yarn weight also comes with a reccomended hook size (the symbol as a whole refered to as gague). For knitters, there is a similar gague section for knitting needles. For example, it would not make much sense to use a teeny-tiny hook on jumbo yarn. This symbol is typically located near or next to the yarn weight indicator. The symbol itself consists of a picture of a crochet hook, the hook size in milimeters and US size, and numbers along the left and top side that indicate the size of the gague square. The numbers along the right and bottom of the square indicate how many rows and stitches the gague sqaure comprises of. Gague squares are used to help crafters understand how large/small/tight/loose their sitiches should be for a pattern.\n\nTelling Yarn Weight Without A Label\nNow having a label to tell you a yarns weight is all well and good, but what happens if the label is missing? Most crocheters and knitters then use a method called Wraps Per Inch. This method requires a ruler, the mystery yarn, and (optionally) an object with a consistent circumfrence.To calculate the weight, simply wrap the yarn around an inch of your obejct (or ruler) counting the number of wraps. It is better to wrap a little tighter since you do not want to leave gaps or loose pockets. Once you have the number of wraps, simply match it to the standard number of wraps for a yarn weight."

        important: "Deciding where to insert your hook has a big impact in how the resulting crochet work turns out. In some cases, pattern writers even specify where to insert one's hook.", 
        content: "\nThere are three main locations where you can insert your hook: back of the loop, front of the loop, or top of the stitch. Between stitches and post are two of the less common hook insertion points and beginners do not have to worry about those till later in their journey\n\nInserting at the top of the stitch is the default insertion location to the point where if pattern writiers don't specify a location you should assume they mean the top. You can tell the top of a stitch by looking at the top of your first row. The top of a stitch makes a '>' shape. If the stitches happen to make a '<' shape you will need to turn your work to the other side. To insert your hook through the top of a stitch, simply insert underneath the two sides of the '>' shape.\n\nLooking at the top of a stitch also helps you to tell where the front and back loops are. When looking at the stitch correctly, the front loop is the bit of stitch closest to you while the back loop is the bit of stitch farthest away from you. To insert your hook into the front loop simply insert under the front loop (disreguard the back loop) and continue on with your stitch. To insert under the back loop do the opposite; disreguard the front loop and simply insert underneath the back loop before continuting the stitch."

By piecing together even a rough timeline we can get a glimpse into the past and understand how such a treasured pasttime survived the ages. It is also interesting to see the transition of crochet from being a mainly practical craft to an almost entirely leisure-based one.", 
        content: "\nTheory #1: Saudai Arabia \nThis theory suggests that crochet began in Saudai Arabia before spreading eastward to Tibet and westward to Spain and then other Mediterranean countries via trade routes.Pamir culture provides some evidence for this theory as their traditional Pamir hooks, thick and colorful socks, and overall culture are closly tied with tied with ancient Persia (a place it is theorized Arabian crochet reached due to similar evidence in the Mediterranean). Otherwise, there is little more evidence that has been popularized.\n\nTheory #2: South America\nSome of the earliest examples of crochet in South America come from adornments supposedly used in rghts of puberty. Primitve tribes where said to crochet these adornments using simple stitches. Sadly, there is not much else surviving information.\n\nTheory #3: China\nThe most common theory is that crochet spawned out of the ancient Chinese practice of tambour. Tambouring did not reach Europe intil the 1700s, and even then did not take on the name crochetuntil the end of the 18th century. Tambouring consisted of stretching a background fabric tightly over a frame. A thread is held underneath the fabric and a hooked needle is pushed through thefabric, hooked on a loop of thread, and pulled back through the fabric. Chain stitches where accomplished by working the hooked needle, with the thread loop still around it, back through the fabric father down with the new thread loop pulled through the old. It is believed the thread was very fine as surviving hooks are a similar size to sewing needles. Early examples include 3D dolls that seem to me made of crocheted stitches"

        content: '\nKnitting, But Second\nWhile it is true knitting does predate crochet, they are both late to the game compared to Nalebinding. Nalebinding is Danish of origin and can be translated to mean "binding with a needle" or "needle binding". Despite it being ancient in origin, it is still practiced today in Pero, Scandinavia, and The Balkans. Being its ancestor, Nalebinding can be mistaken for knitting despite knitting first appearng in Ancient Egypt. All in all, it is safe to say knitting came first (between just knitting and crochet).'
